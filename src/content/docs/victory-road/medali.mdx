This goal requires you to obtain the Medali Gym Badge.
It is obtained by completing the Medali Gym Test and then defeating Larry.

<Aside type="caution">
  You might be tempted to check off this goal after defeating the gym leader. This
  would be a timing error. The earliest you can check off this goal is as soon
  as the badge for beating the gym leader appears on screen.
