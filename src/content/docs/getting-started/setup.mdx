Setting up your save game for bingo is easy, but a bit time consuming, since you
have to play through the whole tutorial.

## Step By Step Guide

<Steps>
1. Create a new profile on your switch and start a new game
2. In settings, turn off automatic saves, nicknames and cutscenes. Set text speed to fast
3. Get any starter Pokémon. If you want to roll for natures, you can save beforehand and do so
4. Continue through the tutorial by doing the minimum requirements. That means:<br />
   no **wild encounters**, no extra **trainer battles**, no **item pickups**, and no **additional flying spots**.<br />
   You should, however, win all the battles except for the fight against Nemona where she introduces Terastalization. Defeat her starter Pokémon and lose to her Tera Electric Pawmi.
5. Finish the school by activating the Starfall Street, Path of Legends and Victory Road quests
6. Open the PokéDex and click through the hint
7. Head to **Mesagoza East Gate** to trigger Arvins phone call
8. Go to Nurse Joy and heal your party until she stops giving you any hints. Make sure that she gives you at least three uninterrupted heals before going to the next step
9. Talk to the TM machine to get the hint out of the way
10. Exit Mesagoza through the **South gate** and have a picnic. Click "Make a Sandwich" to get the hint out of the way. Go to Kuraidon/Miraidon and wash it to get rid of that hint, too
11. Go back into Mesagoza and head to the center of the city to perform a manual save
</Steps>

Your bingo save is now complete! Just be sure to never save over your save file or you'll have to do this process again.
Start your runs from the center of Mesagoza.
