title: Obtain an Egg
description: A goal for obtaining and hatching an egg.
---

This goal requires you to hatch an egg that was acquired through any means, although the only way of obtaining Pokémon Eggs in the base version of Scarlet & Violet is through breeding while having a picnic.

Egg Power 1 or Egg Power 2 are highly recommended to speed up the process.

The breeding rate, or the chance of an Egg being produced, is determined by the Original Trainers of the Pokémon and the species. In Bingo, most cases will be with the same Original Trainer. However, Pokémon obtained via the in-game trades will have different Original Trainers.

| Species   | Original Trainer | Chance for Egg  |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Same      | Same             | 15.63% / 40/256 |
| Same      | Different        | 31.25% / 80/256 |
| Different | Same             | 3.91%  / 10/256 |
| Different | Different        | 11.72% / 30/256 |
